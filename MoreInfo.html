<p>Only 9% of all plastic waste in Canada is actually being recycled. 
This is due to the relatively high contamination rate of these materials. 
Whereby,The average contamination rate is 25%, meaning that 1 out of 4 items placed
in a recycling bin cannot be recycled. This contamination leads to landfill overflow,
facility risks, and increased costs for the government. This problem 
desperately needs a solution.
<br>
<br>
 Effective and proper recycling actively combats a variety of enviromental issues that being anywhere from water pollution to climate change. In the case of 
 climate change, uneffective recycling methods result in contaminated plastic being thrown into landfills - wherein due to constant sun exposure they release greenhouse such as ethylene or 
 even methane whose potency is 25 times that of carbon dioxide. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Despite 72% of Canadian beverage containers being recycled, the average contamination rates reach are over 20% in cities like Edmonton, Toronto and Halifax.   
 While food contamination does not affect the plastic recycling process, a small amount of food or liquid on a piece of paper can make a tonne of paper unrecyclable
 and as such drastically impacts the efficiency of the recycling process. The degree of contamination in Canadian waste is such a problem that if Torontoâ€™s average contamination rate
 passes 27%, they will be charged $5 million extra per year. This is because contamination is a waste of resources - seeing as it undermines the efforts of not
 only the recycler, the recylcing plant and the government itself. 
 <br>
 <br>
According to CBC, 90% of people are willing to change their lives to 
help the environment. However, they are only willing to spend less than $100 per year doing so and this solution must not be time-consuming. As such the 
Canadian government put forth the recommendation of rinsing recyclables to decrease total decontamination - but less than 5% of Canadians do. Many do not
understand both the enviromental and financial strain improper recycling truly puts on the system, but in Toronto alone, it is estimated that lowering the contamination rate by
1% could save between $600,000 and $1 million for the city every year.
